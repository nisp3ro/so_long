# Unified Library: libft + ft_printf + get_next_line

This project unifies three of my 42 Cursus projects into a single static library. It includes:

- **libft:** Custom implementations of standard C library functions along with additional utilities.
- **ft_printf:** A custom version of `printf` with bonus formatting options.
- **get_next_line:** A function to read a file line by line.
